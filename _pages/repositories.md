</div>
Drew Survivor, I will probably do the other scugs too!

<div class="row">

        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/wallTPAC.jpg title: "Rain World The Wall " class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
The top of The Wall in Rivulets timeline, I liked the colour scheme of the sky so I wanted to try drawing it.


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> 
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/mamino4.jpg title: " Rain World OC Mamino " class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> 
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/saintAscension.jpg title: " Rain World saint ascension " class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
I was attempting to draw all the Ascension moments most of them looked pretty crap, Saint's one however was decent.


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> 
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/mirosbird.jpg title: " Rain World miros bird " class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
Drew a sketch of a Miros Bird then I turned it into a proper painting.


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> 
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/waterTPAC.jpg title: " rain world rivulet water " class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
An experiment trying to draw water, (its meant to be rivulet drowning or something like that)


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> 
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/YeekTPAC.jpg title: " Rain World yeek " class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
ITS A YEEEK!!! for all the fellow Yeek people.


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> 
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/mamino3.jpg title: " Rain World oc mamino " class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
Mamino's eyes just got ripped out I guess, I should of lessened the outline a bit though.


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> 
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/guardian.jpg title: " Rain World guardian void sea " class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
A Guardian guarding the world wide massive worm infested deep fryer! 


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> 
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/mamino2.jpg title: " Rain World oc mamino " class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
Mamino jumping the gap to Flowing Vines superstucture, this took me an unholy amount of time for the quality that it is at.


<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> 
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/mamino1.jpg title: " Rain World oc mamino " class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    
    
</div>
Mamino but a child!
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> 
        {% responsive_image path: assets/img/maminoRise.jpg title: " Rain World mamino oc " class: "img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
Did this a while back and I thought it didn't look horrible, I do have a series of Mamino paintings but since this is quite outdated I have put it at the bottom (the paintings are in time order, bottom being oldest, top being newest.) The time this is set is very late in the series.
