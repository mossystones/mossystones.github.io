Hello, I am MossyStones! I am a beginner in digital art and mostly use Procreate. 
I do a lot of rain world art and stuff from a few other games, I’m into botany and have a marimo moss ball. 
I aim to get better at art since I’m still learning and this is my first time using GitHub to make a website, I also never use AI for my art.
I enjoy playing Portal 1 and 2, Rain World, The Finals and Gang Beasts.
